	<h4>Ingredients List</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Yeast</li>
		<li>Sugar</li>
		<li>Bread Flour</li>
		<li>Olive Oil</li>
		<li>Salt</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Steps</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on the counter for about 5 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.</li>
		<li>You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color.</li>
		<li>You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about â…“-inch thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and toppings.</li>
